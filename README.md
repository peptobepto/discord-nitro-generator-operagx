# discord-nitro-generator-operagx
a python script i threw together in half an hour to automate post requests to the opera gx nitro thing.
you can get about 800 or so keys before you have to rotate proxies. Proxy rotating isnt set up properly but it exists if you 
want to impliment it

I just havent becuase my proxy list is dogshit.
anyway, have fun with free nitro!

P.S: for all my script kiddies out there, pls remember to pip install all the required libraries BEFORE running the code
